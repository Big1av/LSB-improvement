===============================
This is a Chrone/Firefox userscript that aims to right some of the wrongs that LSB have done with their new redesign.
The goal is to make the current available information be presented in a better way so nothing gets hidden, even if you

=======
Currently the goal is to make the bank look well in their own minimum requirement for screen resolution: 1024x768.

Possible future support:
* Use the full width of the browser in a fluid layout
* Support for resolutions lower than 1024x768, like mobile devices
